            <h3>Parasite (2019)</h3>
        </li>

        </li>
        <p><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's 2019 period comedy-drama film set in 1969 Los
                Angeles, following fading TV actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth
                (Brad Pitt) as they navigate the changing film industry and navigate their lives near the infamous

                to Dalton, weaving fictional storylines with historical events to create a "rage fantasy" exploring how
                things could have gone differently on the night of the Tate murders.</i></p>

                a book by Michael Lewis, follows several key players—including hedge-fund manager Mark Baum (Steve
                Carell), investor Michael Burry (Christian Bale), and banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling)—as they
                navigate the dark underbelly of modern banking and realize that a massive economic collapse is
                imminent.</i></p>
